HtmlRowCloning
==============

This is a demo file that I'm using to flesh out the process of creating and populating a dynamic number of rows and columns for two tables based on data that's returned from the server. In the actual project it is used to populate data in a dynamic form when the input does not pass server side validation and is passed back to the user.
